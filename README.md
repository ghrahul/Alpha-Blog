# Important Notes

* To run server "rails s -b  $IP -p $PORT" 
* gems are ruby programs and libraries.
* bundle install is bundler gem which goes to ruby gems and install all the default gems.
* Routes are in routes.rb
* Helpers are common logic for views.
* database.yml for database configuration.
* seeds.rb for database migrations storage.
* All the logs from server output will be stored in logs.
* Public folder has html pages that are directly available.
* Automated tests happened in test directory.
* In vendor we have all installed gem files.
* README.md contains information which we want to expose about our application.
* By default web server is webrick.
* "rake routes" cmd is for checking what routes are available.
* action means method in controller class.
* for each action we need template in views.
* <% %> for writing ruby code inside template.
* <%= this is going to render what is evaluated.
* Rails use active record pattern to communicate with database.
* "rails generate scaffold Article title:string description:text" will create table named Article and corresponding controller and model routes and all other things which are required.
* "rails generate scaffold Model columns:type model:references" for creating a foreign key reference between models.
* "rails destroy scaffold Model" to destroy a model.
* "rake db:migrate" for migrating database by creating tables.
* "rake route | grep articles" to see all the routes for articles.
* "CRUD" operation comes inbuilt!!!
* "rails generate migration create_articles" to generate a migration.
* Model.create(args) for direct entry of values.
* "article.errors.any?" to check if there is any error with article entry.
* "article.errors.full_messages" to show the full message related to error.
* "application.html.erb" file wraps all the views.
* Partials are used to make code redundent "_form.html.erb"
* "heroku run rake db:migrate" for migrating databse with heroku.
* "has_many" should be added in the model which has one to many relation.
* Any change is instantly reflected in the Active Record objects. The mapping that binds a given Active Record

* "rails generate migration add_user_id_to_articles" to create association between articles and users
* "byebug" gem is used for debugging.

* resource.authenticate('password') for comparing password.
* Methods that are crreated in application controller are available to all the controllers.Not available in views by default.
* setup method will start first whenever we start testing.
* "rake test" cmd to start all test cases.
